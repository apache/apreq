UPDATING THE WEBSITE:
        (cf: http://jakarta.apache.org/site/jakarta-site2.html )

  RedHat Linux Instructions:

  1) Download and install j2re and j2sdk rpms from Sun's
     website:

        http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.3/download.html

    FreeBSD note:
        Sun certified FreeBSD java binaries can be dowloaded
        and added via pkg_add (1.5.x)

        http://www.freebsdfoundation.org/downloads/java.shtml

  2) Download the latest binary release of Apache Ant:

        http://ant.apache.org/bindownload.cgi

    (I just expanded the tar.gz file in /usr/java/ant, which
     is alongside the jre and jdk directory trees.)

    FreeBSD note:
        via ports/packages /usr/ports/devel/apache-ant

  3) Prep the (bash) environment:

    $ export ANT_HOME=/usr/java/ant/apache-ant-1.5.3-1
    $ export PATH=$PATH:$ANT_HOME/bin
    $ export JAVA_HOME=/usr/java/jdk1.3.1_07

    FreeBSD note:
        This is done for you via /usr/ports/java/javavmwrapper
        which is a dependency of the jdk binary in step one
        and will be installed for you.

  4) BUILDING THE DOXYGEN DOCUMENTATION:

     Be sure doxygen is installed on your machine.  Then cd to 
     the base directory (httpd-apreq-2) and run

        % make docs

     FreeBSD/Solaris note: use gmake!

     This will generate the C documentation in the docs/ directory
     using build/doxygen.conf as the config file for doxygen.
     

  5) Check out httpd/site/ from svn.apache.org and run
     svn co https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/httpd/site/trunk

    $ cd httpd/site/trunk
    $ emacs xdocs/apreq/*
    $ ant

  6) copy docs/html/* to http/site/trunk/xdocs/apreq/docs/libapreq2
  
     [XXX: tags files / man pages ????]

  7) commit the changes as follows:
    
    $ svn commit -m "released libapreq2-2.15" xdocs/apreq/ docs/apreq/

    [do this before you make your RELEASE annoucement and deal with any issues first]

    Wait for ajax to sync every 1-2 hours or so....

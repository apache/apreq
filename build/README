        General Info on the httpd-apreq community.
        Utility scripts for building & packaging httpd-apreq-2.



UPDATING THE httpd-apreq HOME PAGE:

RedHat Linux:
  1) Download and install j2re and j2sdk rpms from Sun's
     website:

        http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.3/download.html

  2) Download the latest binary release of Apache Ant:

        http://ant.apache.org/bindownload.cgi

    I just expanded the tar.gz file in /usr/java/ant, which
    is alongside the jre and jdk directory trees.

  3) Prep the (bash) environment:

    $ export ANT_HOME=/usr/java/ant/apache-ant-1.5.3-1
    $ export PATH=$PATH:$ANT_HOME/bin
    $ export JAVA_HOME=/usr/java/jdk1.3.1_07

  4) Check out httpd-site from cvs.apache.org and run

    $ cd httpd-site
    $ emacs xdocs/apreq/index.html
    $ ant
    $ cvs commit -m "Added info on public cvs access, snapshots and list
    archives for apreq." xdocs/apreq/index.html docs/apreq/index.html

  5) Wait 24 hours for the changes to appear on the website.

To install the Perl and C libraries, simply run:

 perl Makefile.PL && make && make test && make install

The libapreq.a and header files will be installed in the Perl
architecture dependent library.  See the Apache::libapreq module for
routines that can be called by your application Makefile to find the
include and linker arguments.

If the test suite doesn't find your httpd, you should help it to find it.
If your httpd is built as DSO:

 perl Makefile.PL -apxs /path/to/apache/bin/apxs 

If your httpd is static:

 perl Makefile.PL -httpd /path/to/apache/bin/httpd

To build libapreq without the Makefile.PL, run:

 ./configure [--with-apache-includes=DIR] && make

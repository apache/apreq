--------------------------------------------------
IMPORTANT NOTE: To install the Perl modules, your 
mod_perl installation MUST includes support for 
Apache::Table.  This means that mod_perl should
be built using the EVERYTHING=1, or at minimum 
PERL_TABLE_API=1.  If you see errors like this 
(during compilation of libapreq)

  Error: 'Apache::Table' not in typemap in Request.xs,

your mod_perl must be rebuilt to include Apache::Table 
support.
--------------------------------------------------

To install the Perl and C libraries, simply run:

 perl Makefile.PL && make && make test && make install

The libapreq.a and header files will be installed in the Perl
architecture dependent library.  See the Apache::libapreq module for
routines that can be called by your application Makefile to find the
include and linker arguments.

If the test suite doesn't find your httpd, you should help it to find it.
If your httpd is built as DSO:

 perl Makefile.PL -apxs /path/to/apache/bin/apxs 

If your httpd is static:

 perl Makefile.PL -httpd /path/to/apache/bin/httpd

--------------------------------------------------

Alternatively, to build and install a shared version 
of libapreq using GNU libtool, do this:

 ./configure --with-apache-includes=DIR && make && make install

Note: The mod_perl API (Apache::Request and Apache::Cookie) will
link against this version of libapreq if it is available.  That
means if you're upgrading from an older version of libapreq.so, 
that was installed using this "./configure" method, you may need 
to upgrade the old library installation PRIOR to building Request.so
and Cookie.so:

 ./configure --with-apache-includes=DIR && make && make install
 perl Makefile.PL && make && make test && make install

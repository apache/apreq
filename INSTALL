To install the Perl and C libraries, simply run:

 perl Makefile.PL && make install

The libapreq.a and header files will be installed in the Perl
architecture dependent library.  See the Apache::libapreq module for
routines that can be called by your application Makefile to find the
include and linker arguments.

To build libapreq without the Makefile.PL, run:

 ./configure [--with-apache-includes=DIR] && make

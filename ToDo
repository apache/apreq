o look for 'XXX' in the source, they mark some bits of code that need work

o port to apache 2.0

o multipart_buffer_headers punts on headers more than 5k (which could
  happen with a really long form input name, for example). better than
  the old behavior of locking up, but we could be clever and actually
  handle this.

o should probably handle Apache::Request->param http://blah.com/?foo
  like CGI.pm does (turn it into a param named "keywords")

o win32 port
  - randy kobes has patches for this. requires some patches to
    be applied to mod_perl itself to reduce the changes necessary
    here

o Perl's FILE* typemap leaks!
  - randy's win32 patch changes FILE * to PerlIO *. related?

o libapreq.so

o mmap upload files

o investigate USE_MY_TMPNAME more

o ApacheHTML?

o for mod_dtcl, it may be good to allow a callback function for
  storing file uploads (since it is configurable to store the
  uploads in memory instead of to disk)

o allow the directory for temporary files to be specified? we
  currently use tmpfile(), though, and we'd have to do a secure
  temp-file-creating function to do this.

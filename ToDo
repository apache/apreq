o look for 'XXX' in the source, they mark some bits of code that need work

o port to apache 2.0

o multipart_buffer_headers punts on headers more than 5k (which could
  happen with a really long form input name, for example). better than
  the old behavior of locking up, but we could be clever and actually
  handle this.

o should probably handle Apache::Request->param http://blah.com/?foo
  like CGI.pm does (turn it into a param named "keywords")

o libapreq.so ?

o mmap upload files ?

o port to Mac OS/X

o improve/automate build process for c, dtcl (autoconf support?)

o Fix our Apache::Test-based test suite

o optional build/link of libapreq.a directly into httpd?

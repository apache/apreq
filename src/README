Data structures and relations:

  BASE:

    apreq_value_t:  basic type for handling opaque data.  The type
                    is meant to be extended by placing all "metadata"
                    in front (within a larger structure).

    apreq_table_t : apreq_value_t container. treats value_t as 
                    "key -> data" pair and provides lookup api.  
                    Custom copy/merge functions can be added to 
                    internally handle additional metadata attached
                    to the contained apreq_value_t's.


  COOKIE EXTENSIONS:

    apreq_cookie_t: extends apreq_value_t to represent server-side
                cookie data.

    apreq_jar_t: Just a table with cookie-based copy/merge functions.


  PARAM EXTENSIONS:

    apreq_param_t: extends apreq_value_t to represent POST param data.

    apreq_request_t: maintains arg/body tables which represent parsed data.


  PARSER EXTENSIONS:

    apreq_parser_t: extends apreq_value_t to represent a parser callback,
                    with its associated configuration data.

    The apreq_table_t extension for managing parsers is currently
                   environment-dependent.  Environments are 
                   extension-agnostic.

=head1 NAME

Apache::*::Table - Table classes for Apache::Request, Apache::Upload, and Apache::Cookie.

=for testing
    use Apache::Upload;
    use Apache::Cookie;
    use APR::Pool;
    use APR::Table;
    $r = APR::Pool->new; # environment object



=head1 SYNOPSIS

=for example begin

    my $table = Apache::Request::Table->new($r);
    $table->{test} = 1;
    $table->{foo} = "bar1";
    $table->add(foo => "bar2");

    {
        my $do_data = "";
        $table->do( sub { $do_data .= "@_,"; 1 } );
        ok $do_data eq "test 1,foo bar1,foo bar2,";
    }

=for example end

=for example_testing
  #run the above tests, don't just compile them




=head1 DESCRIPTION

This manpage documents the Apache::*::Table classes provided by the
Apache::Request, Apache::Upload, and Apache::Cookie modules.  Table
classes are all derived from APR::Table, however since the underlying 
values they contain are not simple character arrays, the C<merge>, C<compress>,
and C<overlap> methods from APR::Table are not implemented.




=head1 Apache::Request::Table

These tables arise as parameter tables generated by the C<args>, C<body>, and 
C<param> methods of Apache::Request.  Their values are representable 
by orinary perl scalars, but unlike APR::Table, the '\0' character may 
be safely embedded in a value without truncating it.


=for example begin

    my $table = Apache::Request::Table->new($r);
    my $value = "bar\0quux";
    $table->{foo} = $value;

=for example end

=for example_testing
    is $table->{foo}, $value;




=head1 Apache::Upload::Table

These tables arise from the C<Apache::Request::upload> method (which is
provided by Apache::Upload).  Their values are Apache::Upload objects.


=for example begin

    my $upload = Apache::Upload->new($r, name => "foo", file => __FILE__);
    my $table = Apache::Upload::Table->new($r);
    $table->add($upload);
    $upload = $table->{foo};

=for example end

=for example_testing
    ok $upload->isa("Apache::Upload");




=head1 Apache::Cookie::Table

These tables arise from the C<cookies> method of Apache::Cookie::Jar, and
their values are Apache::Cookie objects (or Apache::Cookie derived objects- 
see the discussion of C<VALUE_CLASS> in L<Apache::Cookie>).

=for example begin

    my $cookie = Apache::Cookie->new($r, name =>"foo", value => "bar");
    my $table = Apache::Cookie::Table->new($r);
    $table->{foo} = $cookie;
    $cookie = $table->{foo};

=for example end
    ok $cookie->isa("Apache::Cookie");

=head1 SUBCLASSING

APR::Request

If the instances of your subclass are hash references then you can actually
inherit from APR::Request as long as the APR::Request object is stored in
an attribute called "r" or "_r". (The APR::Request class effectively does the
delegation for you automagically, as long as it knows where to find the
APR::Request object to delegate to.)  For example:

	package MySubClass;
	use APR::Request::Custom;
	our @ISA = qw(APR::Request);
	sub new {
		my($class, @args) = @_;
		return bless { r => APR::Request::Custom->handle(@args) }, $class;
	}

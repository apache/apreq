=head1 DESCRIPTION

The C<< APR::Request >> module provides the base methods
for interfacing with libapreq2's module API.  It also provides
a few utility functions and constants.

This manpage documents version 2.07
of the APR::Request, APR::Request::Custom,
APR::Request::Cookie::Table, and
APR::Request::Param::Table packages.



=head1 METHODS

APR::Request::Custom - derived from APR::Request.




=head2 handle

    APR::Request::Custom->handle($pool,
                                 $query_string,
                                 $cookie_header,
                                 $parser,
                                 $read_limit,
                                 $brigade)

Creates a new APR::Request::Custom object.  The $query_string
and $cookie_headers are immediately parsed into the C<args> and
C<jar> tables.  The $parser is an APR::Request::Parser object
which is invoked when fetching C<body> entries from the $brigade.
The $read_limit represents the maximum number of bytes this handle
may feed into the parser.





=head1 METHODS

APR::Request




=head2 pool

    $req->pool()

Returns the APR::Pool object associated to this handle.




=head2 bucket_alloc

    $req->bucket_alloc()

Returns the APR::BucketAlloc object associated to this handle.




=head2 jar_status

    $req->jar_status()

Returns the final status code of the handle's cookie header parser.




=head2 args_status

    $req->args_status()

Returns the final status code of the handle's query-string parser.




=head2 body_status

    $req->body_status()

Returns the final status code of the handle's body parser.




=head2 param_status

    $req->param_status()

Returns C<< ($req->args_status, $req->body_status) >> in list
context; otherwise returns C<< $req->args_status || $req->body_status >>.


=head2 parse

    $req->parse()

Parses the jar, args, and body tables. Returns
C<< $req->jar_status, $req->args_status, $req->body_status >>.


=head2 jar

    $req->jar()
    $req->jar($key)

With no arguments, this method returns a tied APR::Request::Cookie::Table
object in scalar context, or the names (in order, with repetitions) of all
the parsed cookies.

With the C<$key> argument, in scalar context this method fetches the first
matching cookie.  In list context it returns all matching cookies.
The returned cookies are the values as they appeared in the incoming
Cookie header.



=head2 args

    $req->args()
    $req->args($key)

With no arguments, this method returns a tied APR::Request::Param::Table
object in scalar context, or the names (in order, with repetitions) of all
the parsed query-string arguments.

With the C<$key> argument, in scalar context this method fetches the first
matching query-string arg.  In list context it returns all matching args.



=head2 body

    $req->body()
    $req->body($key)

With no arguments, this method returns a tied APR::Request::Param::Table
object in scalar context, or the names (in order, with repetitions) of all
the parsed cookies.

With the C<$key> argument, in scalar context this method fetches the first
matching body param.  In list context it returns all matching body params.



=head2 param

    $req->param()
    $req->param($key)

With no arguments, this method returns a tied APR::Request::Cookie::Table
object in scalar context, or the names (in order, with repetitions) of all
the incoming (args + body) params.

With the C<$key> argument, in scalar context this method fetches the first
matching param.  In list context it returns all matching params.




=head2 upload

    $req->upload()
    $req->upload($key)




=head2 uploads (APR::Request::Param::Table???)

    $req->uploads($pool)




=head2 read_limit

    $req->read_limit()
    $req->read_limit($set)




=head2 brigade_limit

    $req->brigade_limit()
    $req->brigade_limit($set)

Get/set the brigade_limit for the current parser.  This limit
determines how many bytes of a file upload that the parser may
spool into main memory.  Uploads exceeding this limit are written
directly to disk.


=head2 temp_dir

    $req->temp_dir()
    $req->temp_dir($set)

Get/set the spool directory for uploads which exceed the configured
brigade_limit.


=head2 disable_uploads

    $req->disable_uploads()

Engage the disable_uploads hook for this request.




=head2 upload_hook

    $req->upload_hook($callback)

Add an upload hook callback for this request.  The
arguments to the $callback sub are ($upload, $new_data).




=head2 import

Exports a list of subs into the caller's package.


=head1 SUBROUTINES

APR::Request




=head2 encode

    encode($string)

Exportable sub which returns the url-encoded form of C<$string>.




=head2 decode

    decode($string)

Exportable sub which returns the url-decoded form of C<$string>.




=head1 SUBCLASSING

APR::Request

If the instances of your subclass are hash references then you can actually
inherit from APR::Request as long as the APR::Request object is stored in
an attribute called "r" or "_r". (The APR::Request class effectively does the
delegation for you automagically, as long as it knows where to find the
APR::Request object to delegate to.)  For example:

	package MySubClass;
	use APR::Request::Custom;
	our @ISA = qw(APR::Request);
	sub new {
		my($class, @args) = @_;
		return bless { r => APR::Request::Custom->handle(@args) }, $class;
	}





=head1 METHODS

  APR::Request::Cookie::Table - read-only version of APR::Table.

Tables in this class normally arise from calls to
C<< APR::Request::jar() >>.




=head2 cookie_class

    $table->cookie_class()
    $table->cookie_class($set)

Get/set the class each table element is blessed into during a
L<get> or L<FETCH> call.  If defined, the class must be derived
from APR::Request::Cookie.  When called with $set, it returns
the $table.  Otherwise it returns the name of the current class,
or undef if no cookie class is defined.



=for example begin

    {
        package FOO;
        @ISA= 'APR::Request::Cookie';
    }

    $jar->cookie_class("FOO");
    ok $_->isa("FOO") for values %$jar;

=for example end

=for example_testing
    $jar->do(sub { ok $_[1]->isa("FOO"); });




=head2 get

    $table->get($key)

Same as FETCH.



=head2 FETCH

    $table->FETCH($key)

In scalar context, this returns the first value matching
$key (note: see NEXTKEY for additional notes).  The match
is always case-insensitive.  In list context, this returns
all matching values.  Note: the type of the return values
depends on the table's current cookie_class.




=head2 EXISTS

Synonym for C<< defined >>; these tables are not
allowed to contain undefined values. Since these
are constant tables, they don't autovivify either.




=head2 FIRSTKEY

    $table->FIRSTKEY()

Returns the first key in the table.




=head2 NEXTKEY

    $table->NEXTKEY()

Returns the next key in the table.  For perl 5.8+,
if the key is multivalued, a subsequent FETCH on
this key will return the corresponding value, until
either NEXTKEY or FIRSTKEY is invoked again.  For
perl 5.6, FETCH always returns the first value.




=head2 do

    $table->do($callback, @keys)

Same as APR::Table::do; iterates over the table
calling $callback->($key, $value) for each matching
@keys.  If @keys is empty, this iterates over the
entire table.

Note: The type of $value inserted into the callback
depends on the table's current cookie_class.




=head1 METHODS

APR::Request::Param::Table




=head2 param_class

    $table->param_class()
    $table->param_class($set)


Get/set the class each table element is blessed into during a
C<get> or C<FETCH> call.  If defined, the class must be derived
from APR::Request::Param.  When called with $set, it returns
the $table.  Otherwise it returns the name of the current class,
or undef if no param class is defined.




=head2 get

    $table->get($key)

Same as FETCH.




=head2 FETCH

    $table->FETCH($key)

In scalar context, this returns the first value matching
$key (see NEXTKEY for additional notes on this).  The match
is always case-insensitive.  In list context, this returns
all matching values.  Note: the type of the return values
depends on the table's current param_class.



=head2 EXISTS

Synonym for C<< defined >>; these tables are not
allowed to contain undefined values. Since these
are constant tables, they don't autovivify either.




=head2 NEXTKEY

    $table->NEXTKEY()

Returns the next key in the table.  For perl 5.8+,
if the key is multivalued, a subsequent FETCH on
this key will return the corresponding value, until
either NEXTKEY or FIRSTKEY is invoked again.  For
perl 5.6, FETCH always returns the first value.




=head2 FIRSTKEY

    $table->FIRSTKEY()

Returns the first key in the table.




=head2 do

    $table->do($callback, @keys)

Same as APR::Table::do; iterates over the table
calling $callback->($key, $value) for each matching
@keys.  If @keys is empty, this iterates over the
entire table.

Note: The type of $value inserted into the callback
depends on the table's current value_class.

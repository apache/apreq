Instructions for the httpd-apreq-2 Release Manager (RM)

1. Prep the package for CPAN by running:

        % make release

   This will generate a libapreq2-2.XX.tar.gz candidate in the 
   current directory.   You should keep this source tree
   intact to tag the final release.

2. Test the generated file with

        % make release_test

   Make sure all perl tests pass.

3. Upload a release candidate to httpd.apache.org/~username
   and post a candidate announcement to apreq-dev@.  The RM
   or any other apreq committer may call for a formal vote on the 
   candidate, but a formal vote is not a requirement for the release. 
   Also, it is strongly recommended that the RM crosspost the 
   candidate announcement to the modperl@ list, to solicit feedback
   from a much larger audience.

4. Give the mailing list participants 48-72 hours to comment and
   vote on the candidate.  If there is a "majority consensus" 
   (three +1 and more +1s than -1s) among the committers, the RM 
   may proceed with the release.

5.  Tag the tree, s/./_/g in the version number

    % cvs tag v2_XX

6. Sign the release via gpg:

     % gpg --detach-sign --armor libapreq2-2.XX.tar.gz

   or pgp:

     % pgp -sba libapreq2-2.XX.tar.gz

7. Upload (scp) the package and signature to www.apache.org
   for distribution:

    % scp libapreq2-2.XX.tar.gz* \
      <username>@www.apache.org:/www/www.apache.org/dist/httpd/libapreq/

   Ask another developer to confirm the uploaded signature is ok.

    % gpg --verify libapreq2-2.XX.tar.gz.asc
    % pgp libapreq2-2.XX.tar.gz.asc

   Check that your public key is among those listed in the
   /www/www.apache.org/dist/httpd/KEYS file.

8. Upload the package to CPAN. Doublecheck that the md5 checksum
   received from PAUSE is correct.

9. Update the libapreq homepage to list the new release in
   the News section. For instructions on updating the httpd website, 
   see build/WEBSITE.

10. Post a final announcement to the modperl@ and apreq-dev@ lists:

        Subject: [ANNOUNCE] libapreq2-2.XX release

    Include the md5 signature in the announcement, as well as
    a list of the latest version info and changes since the 
    previous release.

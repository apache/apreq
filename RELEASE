Instructions for httpd-apreq Release Manager (RM)

1. Prep the package for CPAN by running:

        % sh BUILD.sh
        % perl Makefile.PL
        % make dist

   This will generate a libapreq-1.X.tar.gz candidate in the 
   current directory.   You should keep this source tree
   intact to generate the final release.

2. Test the generated file's './configure ...' build and
   'perl Makefile.PL ...' build. Make sure all perl tests pass.

3. Upload a release candidate to httpd.apache.org/~username
   and post a candidate announcement to apreq-dev@.

4. Give the apreq-dev@ participants 48 hours to comment on
   the candidate.  If there's no problems, proceed to the next
   step.  Otherwise, try to address the issues, commit fixes to,
   cvs, and start over.  You can repeat this process on the 
   modperl@ list, but that choice is up to the RM.

5. The candidate is ok. Now return to the original source tree
   and edit ./Changes:

   =item 1.X - <Today's Date>

   libapreq-1.X released.

6.  Tag the tree, s/./_/g in the version number, and roll the release.

    % cvs tag v1_X
    % make dist

7. Test the release package, repeating step 2.  If all tests pass,
   sign it via gpg:

     % gpg --detach-sign --armor libapreq-1.X.tar.gz

   or pgp:

     % pgp -sba libapreq-1.X.tar.gz

8. Upload (scp) the package and signature to www.apache.org
   for distribution:

    % scp libapreq-1.X.tar.gz libapreq-1.X.tar.gz.asc \
      <username>@www.apache.org:/www/httpd.apache.org/dist/httpd/libapreq/

   Get another developer to confirm the uploaded signature is ok.

    % gpg --verify libapreq-1.X.tar.gz.asc
    % pgp libapreq-1.X.tar.gz.asc

9. Upload the package to CPAN. Doublecheck that the md5 checksum
   received from PAUSE is correct.

10. Post announcement to modperl@ and apreq-dev@ list:

        Subject: [ANNOUNCE] libapreq 1.X release

    Include the md5 signature in the announcement, as well as
    a list of the latest Changes (since the previous release).

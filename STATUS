/** @page STATUS

     2.03-dev under development

Contributors looking for a mission:

    - just do an egrep on "TODO" or "XXX" and see what's there


CURRENT RELEASE NOTES:

    - This is a developer release, indicated by the "-dev" suffix
      on the version string.  We believe the core interfaces to be stable,
      but some portions of the API may still need significant modification.
      Thus, binary/source compatibility may be broken from one developer 
      release to the next. In particular the version numbering rules specified
      at

                 http://apr.apache.org/versioning.html

      do not apply to developer releases.


RELEASE SHOWSTOPPERS:

    - License for Perl API (pod and pm files) needs updating to ASLv2. See
      http://www.apache.org/dev/apply-license.html

    - Include perl glue for CGI environment.


CURRENT VOTES:

    - Should we switch to EU::MM for determining the full path to perl?
      The problem is that some folks move their perl binary post-installation,
      but never adjust Config.pm.  EU::MM is smart, by accepting a 
      full path in $^X or by searching the user's $PATH for $^X, before
      resorting to Config.pm.  However, if we change apreq2, we should also
      lobby test-dev to adopt the same solution for Apache::Test.  Otherwise
      our test suite will likely fail, even though the rest of the perl build
      system will presumably still work.

TODO:

    - Get env/ (Apache::Test) tests to work for --with-apache2-src option.

    - Bring Perl documentation up to speed.

    - Write parser/hook API documentation.

    - Add XForms logic to the mfd parser.

    - symbol exports files:
      -# aix needs .exp files

    - Clean up apreq_config_t, breaking binary compatibility by removing
      some useless fields in the struct.

    - Fix test_cgi.c (probably a httpd.conf issue) so it passes the
      Apache::Test tests on debian-amd64.


OPEN ISSUES:

    - Should we bundle an apr-based "application/xml" parser?  
      If so, how should we parse the xml data into an apr_table?

    - Clean up the CHANGES file format so it's more readable.

BUGS:

    - Strange bug when ssl is enabled & lots of fields are present: see
        http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?t=107766265600001&r=1&w=2

    - Fix build automake/libtool/autoconf build system so it works
      properly on OSX & AIX.


WISH LIST:

    - I [joes] wish folks would contribute some glue code for
      one of these:

      - php,
      - Rivet,
      - mod_dtcl, 
      - mod_python, 
      - mod_jk, 
      - tomcat,
      - mod_ruby,
      - mod_parrot.

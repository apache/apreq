     2.04-dev under development

Contributors looking for a mission:

    - just do an egrep on "TODO" or "XXX" and see what's there


CURRENT RELEASE NOTES:

    - This is a developer release, indicated by the "-dev" suffix
      on the version string.  We believe the core interfaces to be stable,
      but some portions of the API may still need significant modification.
      Thus, binary/source compatibility may be broken from one developer 
      release to the next. In particular the version numbering rules specified
      at

                 http://apr.apache.org/versioning.html

      do not apply to developer releases.


RELEASE SHOWSTOPPERS:


CURRENT VOTES:

    - Should we switch to EU::MM for determining the full path to perl?
      The problem is that some folks move their perl binary post-installation,
      but never adjust Config.pm.  EU::MM is smart, by accepting a 
      full path in $^X or by searching the user's $PATH for $^X, before
      resorting to Config.pm.  However, if we change apreq2, we should also
      lobby test-dev to adopt the same solution for Apache::Test.  Otherwise
      our test suite will likely fail, even though the rest of the perl build
      system will presumably still work.

    - We are moving from cvs to subversion as soon as it is convenient.
      Vote was taken in March 2004 (http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?t=107919363000001&r=1&w=2)
      and the results were as follows:

TODO:

    - in glue/perl/t/apreq/cgi.t on Win32, printing to the error log
      hangs if the strings involved are about 10000 in size.
      This doesn't occur in the env/cgi tests - why?

    - Why must fprintf(stderr, ...), rather than
      apr_file_printf(err, ...), be used on Win32 in
      cgi_log() of src/apreq_env.c?

    - The current tests don't cover these functions, 
      so add CuTest tests for them:
      -  apreq_make_value()
      -  apreq_copy_value()
      -  apreq_merge_values()
      -  apreq_enctype()
      -  apreq_memmem()
      -  apreq_quote()
      -  apreq_quote_once()
      -  apreq_escape()
      -  apreq_ua_cookie_version()
      -  apreq_encode_param()

    - CuTest needs va_arg to print comments for a failed unit test.

    - Get env/ (Apache::Test) tests to work for --with-apache2-src option.

    - Bring Perl documentation up to speed.

    - Write parser/hook API documentation, and add perl glue for the API.

    - Add XForms logic to the mfd parser.

    - symbol exports files:
      -# aix needs .exp files

    - Install the html dox during "make install".  Should we do this 
      for the doxy manpages also?

    - Rework glue/perl build system to use apreq2-config instead of
      relying on paths like "../../src".


OPEN ISSUES:

    - Should we bundle an apr-based "application/xml" parser?  
      If so, how should we parse the xml data into an apr_table?

    - For 5.8.1+, the current perl-glue implementation enables 
      MAGIC KEYS for all the @keys = $obj->get() calls.  The entries 
      in @keys are scalars with vstring-magic which is survives
      assignment.  The magic contains a pointer to the perl object
      $obj references, and a pointer to the table value associated
      with the key. A subsequent call to $val = $obj->get($key[$n])
      bypasses the normal table lookups, using the magic in $key[$n] 
      to retrieve $val.
      .
      I don't know if the faster lookups balance out the overhead
      of attaching the v-string magic, so it's something that probably
      should be benchmarked.  However the real motivation for this
      was to provide better support for multivalued keys (since a
      magic key "knows" which value it's associated with).  Whether
      or not users will appreciate this feature, or find it too confusing,
      is presently unknown.


BUGS:

    - Fix build automake/libtool/autoconf build system so it works
      properly on OSX & AIX.


WISH LIST:

    - I [joes] wish folks would contribute some glue code for
      one of these:

      - php,
      - Rivet,
      - mod_dtcl, 
      - mod_python, 
      - mod_jk, 
      - tomcat,
      - mod_ruby,
      - mod_parrot.

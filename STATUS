/** @page STATUS

     2.0.1  in development

Contributors looking for a mission:

    - just do an egrep on "TODO" or "XXX" and see what's there


CURRENT RELEASE NOTES:

    - This is unreleased software.


RELEASE SHOWSTOPPERS:

    - Incorporate prereq checks into build system:

      -# perl module checks in Makefile.PL


CURRENT VOTES:


TODO:

    - httpd 2.0.46 is a requirement, need to add the check in
      ./configure and abort if not satisfied.

    - Get env/ (Apache::Test) tests to work for --with-apache2-src option.

    - Bring Perl documentation up to speed.

    - Write parser/hook API documentation.

    - Add XForms logic to the mfd parser.

    - symbol exports files:
      -# win32 now has hardcoded .def files (need to automate, e.g. based
         on exports.c ala httpd-2.0)
      -# aix needs .exp files


OPEN ISSUES:

    - Should we bundle an apr-based "application/xml" parser?  
      If so, how should we parse the xml data into an apr_table?

    - How should the Perl API work in a CGI context?
      Will users need to preload an "CGI environment" module 
      before loading Request.so or Cookie.so?

    - Figure out how to bundle a CPAN release.

BUGS:

  XXX


WISH LIST:

    - I [joes] wish folks would contribute some glue code for
      one of these:

      - php,
      - Rivet,
      - mod_dtcl, 
      - mod_python, 
      - mod_jk, 
      - tomcat,
      - mod_ruby,
      - mod_parrot.

     2.0.0  in development

Contributors looking for a mission:

    * just do an egrep on "TODO" or "XXX" and see what's there


CURRENT RELEASE NOTES:

    * This is unreleased software.


RELEASE SHOWSTOPPERS:

    * Missing Perl API components: 

        1. What should $req->parse do?
        2. How should we encode/decode $cookie->value?
        3. What about CGI?  We can use import() to autoload 
           an environment if none exists, but should we?

CURRENT VOTES:



TODO:

    * Write tests to exercise the filter prefetch code:
         1) Test AAA handler that checks early POST data,
         2) Test output filter w/ a streaming content-handler,
            that needs apreq to read POST data that is beyond 
            what the content handler has already pulled in.

    * Adopt a versioning system for the various components: 
         1) src/,  (libtool-based)
         2) env/,  (module-magic-number ?)   
         3) glue/, (per-language ?)

    * Bring Perl documentation up to speed.

    * Add XForms logic to the mfd parser.

    * symbol exports files:
      - win32 now has hardcoded .def files (need to automate, e.g. based
        on exports.c ala httpd-2.0)
      - aix needs .exp files

    * on Win32, figure out how to build things so Apache::Cookie
      and Apache::Request don't need to be linked against mod_apreq
      to resolve missing apreq_env* symbols. 


OPEN ISSUES:

    * Should we bundle an apr-based "application/xml" parser?  
      If so, how should we parse the xml data into an apr_table?

    * How should the Perl API work in a CGI context?
      Will users need to preload an "CGI environment" module 
      before loading Request.so or Cookie.so?

    * Figure out how to bundle a CPAN release.

BUGS:

  XXX


WISH LIST:

    * I [joes] wish folks would contribute some glue code for
      one of these:

      - php, 
      - mod_tcl, 
      - mod_python, 
      - mod_jk, 
      - mod_ruby,
      - mod_parrot.

    * Someone should also adopt env/libapreq_cgi.c and ensure it
      doesn't fall into disrepair by adding some tests to env/t.

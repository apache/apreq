/** @page apreq_status STATUS

     2.04-dev under development

Contributors looking for a mission:

    - just do an egrep on "TODO" or "XXX" and see what's there


CURRENT RELEASE NOTES:

    - This is a developer release, indicated by the "-dev" suffix
      on the version string.  We believe the core interfaces to be stable,
      but some portions of the API may still need significant modification.
      Thus, binary/source compatibility may be broken from one developer 
      release to the next. In particular the version numbering rules specified
      at

                 http://apr.apache.org/versioning.html

      do not apply to developer releases.


RELEASE SHOWSTOPPERS:


CURRENT VOTES:

    - Should we switch to EU::MM for determining the full path to perl?
      The problem is that some folks move their perl binary post-installation,
      but never adjust Config.pm.  EU::MM is smart, by accepting a 
      full path in $^X or by searching the user's $PATH for $^X, before
      resorting to Config.pm.  However, if we change apreq2, we should also
      lobby test-dev to adopt the same solution for Apache::Test.  Otherwise
      our test suite will likely fail, even though the rest of the perl build
      system will presumably still work.

    - Should we replace req->body with an iterator API (added to
      apreq_parser_t)?  The rationale is that this would make xml
      parsing possible (xml data doesn't map naturally to apr_table_t).
      Xml support is a requirement for XForms.  The disadvantage is that
      there may be a performance hit due to the additional abstractions.

    - We are moving from cvs to subversion as soon as it is convenient.
      Vote was taken in March 2004 (http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?t=107919363000001&r=1&w=2)

TODO:

    - CuTest needs va_arg to print comments for a failed unit test.

    - Add FAQ file.

    - Fix perl glue for CGI environment on Win32.  Add a note to
      version_check.pl that the minimum mp2 version for CGI support is 1.99_15?

    - Get env/ (Apache::Test) tests to work for --with-apache2-src option.

    - Bring Perl documentation up to speed.

    - Write parser/hook API documentation, and add perl glue for the API.

    - Implement DISABLE_UPLOADS as an upload hook.

    - Implement $upload->fh using APR::PerlIO.

    - Add XForms logic to the mfd parser.

    - symbol exports files:
      -# aix needs .exp files

    - Get doxygen to generate manpages for libapreq2, and install both the 
      html documentation and the manpages during "make install".

    - Rework glue/perl build system to use apreq2-config instead of
      relying on paths like "../../src".


OPEN ISSUES:

    - Should we bundle an apr-based "application/xml" parser?  
      If so, how should we parse the xml data into an apr_table?


BUGS:

    - Fix build automake/libtool/autoconf build system so it works
      properly on OSX & AIX.

    - The $jar->cookie, $req->body, and $req->param tables need
      support for adding and setting entries.

WISH LIST:

    - I [joes] wish folks would contribute some glue code for
      one of these:

      - php,
      - Rivet,
      - mod_dtcl, 
      - mod_python, 
      - mod_jk, 
      - tomcat,
      - mod_ruby,
      - mod_parrot.

/** @page STATUS

     2.0.0  in development

Contributors looking for a mission:

    - just do an egrep on "TODO" or "XXX" and see what's there


CURRENT RELEASE NOTES:

    - This is unreleased software.


RELEASE SHOWSTOPPERS:

    - Choose a versioning system:
      -# src/,  (libtool-based, following apr)
      -# env/,  (module-magic-number ?)   
      -# glue/, (per-language ?)

CURRENT VOTES:



TODO:

    - httpd 2.0.46 is a requirement, need to add the check in
      ./configure and abort if not satisfied.

    - Write tests to exercise the filter prefetch code:
         Output filter w/ a streaming content-handler,
         that needs apreq to read POST data that is beyond 
         what the content handler has already pulled in.

    - Bring Perl documentation up to speed.

    - Write parser/hook API documentation.

    - Add XForms logic to the mfd parser.

    - symbol exports files:
      -# win32 now has hardcoded .def files (need to automate, e.g. based
         on exports.c ala httpd-2.0)
      -# aix needs .exp files

    - on Win32, figure out how to build things so Apache::Cookie
      and Apache::Request don't need to be linked against mod_apreq
      to resolve missing apreq_env* symbols. 

    - continue working on the top-level Makefile.PL to completely
      abstract all the targets so one needs to do only:
      perl Makefile.PL && make && make test && make install

OPEN ISSUES:

    - Should we bundle an apr-based "application/xml" parser?  
      If so, how should we parse the xml data into an apr_table?

    - How should the Perl API work in a CGI context?
      Will users need to preload an "CGI environment" module 
      before loading Request.so or Cookie.so?

    - Figure out how to bundle a CPAN release.

BUGS:

  XXX


WISH LIST:

    - I [joes] wish folks would contribute some glue code for
      one of these:

      - php,
      - Rivet,
      - mod_dtcl, 
      - mod_python, 
      - mod_jk, 
      - tomcat,
      - mod_ruby,
      - mod_parrot.

    - Someone should also adopt env/libapreq_cgi.c and ensure it
      doesn't fall into disrepair by adding some tests to env/t.

     2.0.0  in development

Contributors looking for a mission:

    * just do an egrep on "TODO" or "XXX" and see what's there


CURRENT RELEASE NOTES:

    * This is unreleased alpha software.


RELEASE SHOWSTOPPERS:

    * Missing API components: 

        1. Key safety features ("disable uploads", "max body", "temp dir",
           etc.) are unimplemented.

        2. File uploads are `buffered' into a bucket brigade.
           The buckets are currently heap-allocated, which 
           causes the entire file to be spooled into RAM.
           This behavior is unsafe, since large uploads can
           DOS the server by exhausting RAM.

        3. The req->upload API is unimplemented.

    * Filter API (env/mod_apreq.c) is missing key components:

        1. Safety features (see above).

        2. `Prefetching' filter reads are unimplemented.

        3. Filter should activate `as necessary', and inject itself only
           once into the input filter chain.


CURRENT VOTES:



TODO:

    * more core unit tests in t/.
        tables.c needs tests for "balanced" tables

    * Populate the glue/ directory (perl, tcl, etc.).
    

OPEN ISSUES:

  Documentation system.

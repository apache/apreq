     2.03-dev under development

Contributors looking for a mission:

    - just do an egrep on "TODO" or "XXX" and see what's there


CURRENT RELEASE NOTES:

    - This is a developer release, indicated by the "-dev" suffix
      on the version string.  We believe the core interfaces to be stable,
      but some portions of the API may still need significant modification.
      Thus, binary/source compatibility may be broken from one developer 
      release to the next. In particular the version numbering rules specified
      at

                 http://apr.apache.org/versioning.html

      do not apply to developer releases.


RELEASE SHOWSTOPPERS:


CURRENT VOTES:

    - Should we switch to EU::MM for determining the full path to perl?
      The problem is that some folks move their perl binary post-installation,
      but never adjust Config.pm.  EU::MM is smart, by accepting a 
      full path in $^X or by searching the user's $PATH for $^X, before
      resorting to Config.pm.  However, if we change apreq2, we should also
      lobby test-dev to adopt the same solution for Apache::Test.  Otherwise
      our test suite will likely fail, even though the rest of the perl build
      system will presumably still work.

    - Should we replace req->body with an iterator API (added to
      apreq_parser_t)?  The rationale is that this would make xml
      parsing possible (xml data doesn't map naturally to apr_table_t).
      Xml support is a requirement for XForms.  The disadvantage is that
      there may be a performance hit due to the additional abstractions.

    - We are moving from cvs to subversion as soon as it is convenient.
      Vote was taken in March 2004 (http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?t=107919363000001&r=1&w=2)
      and the results were as follows:

TODO:

    - Include perl glue for CGI environment.

    - Get env/ (Apache::Test) tests to work for --with-apache2-src option.

    - Bring Perl documentation up to speed.

    - Write parser/hook API documentation.

    - Add XForms logic to the mfd parser.

    - symbol exports files:
      -# aix needs .exp files

    - Add $upload->slurp to perl API.


OPEN ISSUES:

    - Should we bundle an apr-based "application/xml" parser?  
      If so, how should we parse the xml data into an apr_table?


BUGS:

    - Strange bug when ssl is enabled & lots of fields are present: see
        http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?t=107766265600001&r=1&w=2

    - Fix build automake/libtool/autoconf build system so it works
      properly on OSX & AIX.  FreeBSD cannot build httpd-apreq2 either,
      but there are too many problems with the current (May 2004)
      ports of the auto* tools for us to accomodate FreeBSD (yet).

    - The current API does not handle failed query_string parsing
      adequately (apreq_request does log an error message, but 
      there's no status code in the struct for users to interrogate).

WISH LIST:

    - I [joes] wish folks would contribute some glue code for
      one of these:

      - php,
      - Rivet,
      - mod_dtcl, 
      - mod_python, 
      - mod_jk, 
      - tomcat,
      - mod_ruby,
      - mod_parrot.

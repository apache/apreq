libapreq - Generic Apache Request Library

This package contains modules for manipulating client request data via
the Apache API with Perl and C.  Functionality includes:

 - parsing of application/x-www-form-urlencoded data
 - parsing of multipart/form-data 
 - parsing of HTTP Cookies

See libapreq.pod for the C API documentation and
eg/c/ for examples.

The Perl modules are simply a thin xs layer on top of libapreq,
making them a lighter and faster alternative to CGI.pm and
CGI::Cookie.  See the Apache::Request and Apache::Cookie documentation
for more details and eg/perl/ for examples.

The Perl interface was designed by Lincoln Stein (lstein@cshl.org),
originally implemented as a pure Perl Apache::Request module.
The C implementation has a similar look-and-feel, including structures
modeled from Lincoln's Perl design.

Portions of the C code are based on examples from:
     Writing Apache Modules with Perl and C,

     O'Reilly & Associates, Sebastapol, CA, 1998,

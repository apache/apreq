libapreq - Generic Apache Request Library
http://httpd.apache.org/apreq/

This package contains modules for manipulating client request data via
the Apache API with Perl and C.  Functionality includes:

 - parsing of application/x-www-form-urlencoded data
 - parsing of multipart/form-data 
 - parsing of HTTP Cookies

See libapreq.pod for the C API documentation and
eg/c/ for examples.

The Perl modules are simply a thin xs layer on top of libapreq,
making them a lighter and faster alternative to CGI.pm and
CGI::Cookie.  See the Apache::Request and Apache::Cookie documentation
for more details and eg/perl/ for examples.

The Perl interface was designed by Lincoln Stein (lstein@cshl.org),
originally implemented as a pure Perl Apache::Request module.
The C implementation has a similar look-and-feel, including structures
modeled from Lincoln's Perl design.

IMPORTANT NOTE: To install the Perl modules, your mod_perl installation
MUST includes support for Apache::Table.  This means that mod_perl should
be built using the EVERYTHING=1, or at minimum PERL_TABLE_API=1.  If you
see errors like this (during compilation of libapreq)

        Error: 'Apache::Table' not in typemap in Request.xs,

your mod_perl must be rebuilt to include Apache::Table support.

The Perl API includes a test suite based on Apache::Test.
Type "make test" to run the tests, and be sure Apache::Test
is installed prior to running "perl Makefile.PL".

IMPORTANT NOTE:  The test suite in libapreq-1.1 was based
on Apache::test, which is now in the process of being phased
out of mod_perl-1.X.  During the transition period, some 
platforms may have difficulty running our new test suite.  
Users that have successfully installed libapreq in the past 
may wish to ignore the test results and install anyway, but this
is not recommended.  Please upgrade to the newest version of 
mod_perl-1.X and pull the latest version of Apache::Test 
off of CPAN.

Also, if you have more than one apache+modperl installation on your 
system, Apache::Test might need help in determining which build
to use for the tests.  One way to do this is to pass an -apxs 
or -httpd argument to MakeMaker:

        % perl Makefile.PL -apxs /path/to/apache/bin/apxs
   or
        % perl Makefile.PL -httpd /path/to/apache/bin/httpd

        % make && make test

Please read the INSTALL file and Apache::Test documentation 
for more details.

                    libapreq - Apache Request Library

  What is it?
  -----------
  httpd-apreq (aka `apreq') is subproject of the Apache HTTP Server Project 
  whose membership (aka apreq's `committers') develops and maintains the 
  libapreq software library.

  libapreq is a safe, standards-compliant, high-performance library 
  used for parsing HTTP cookies, query-strings and POST data.  The 
  original version (libapreq-1) was designed by Lincoln Stein and Doug 
  MacEachern.  The perl APIs Apache::Request and Apache::Cookie are the
  lightweight mod_perl analogs of the CGI and CGI::Cookie perl modules.

  The 2.0 version of libapreq is an improved version that's been
  completely redesigned around Apache-2's input filter API.  Here's 
  a brief list of new features:

  * provides overridable parsers for "application/x-www-form-urlencoded",
    "multipart/form-data", and in the future "application/xml" enctypes.

  * accepts chunked POST data.

  * Support for RFC-based Cookies.

  * XForms?

Experimental Patches:

apache-1.3+apreq-1.1.patch  

    patches apache-1.3 source to build libapreq directly into httpd.
    To apply:

        % cd ../../apache-1.3/
        % patch -p0 < ../httpd-apreq/patches/apache-1.3+apreq-1.1.patch

    Then build and install apache (+modperl) as normal.  If you want to
    use Apache::Request and Apache::Cookie, you'll also need to remove
    the -lapreq linking flags within Request/Makefile.PL and
    Cookie/Makefile.PL, before doing the perl build of libapreq.
    The following commands should do the trick:

        % cd ..
        % perl -pi.bak -e 's/-lapreq//' Request/Makefile.PL Cookie/Makefile.PL
        % perl Makefile.PL
        ...
        % make && make test && make install

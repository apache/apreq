   The new filter-based design required a complete 
   departure from libapreq-1.X codebase. libapreq-2
   is based solely on APR, and to be fully functional, 
   requires a supporting environment similar to Apache-2.
   A person wishing to port libapreq-2 to a new environment
   needs to provide definitions for the declarations in apreq_env.h.

   Aggregates are always collected into an APR::Table-based package.
   New table packages: Apache::Cookie::Table, Apache::Request::Table,
   and Apache::Upload::Table.

   Apache::Cookie->fetch now requires an "environment" argument ($r).
   Its return value is blessed into the Apache::Cookie::Jar class.

   Two new request lookup functions:
        1) $req->args - param lookup using only the query string
        2) $req->body - param lookup using only the POST data

Bug first reported by Sven Geisler [joes].

=item 1.31 - ongoing

added a proper implementation of the ithreads support. At the same
time it should resolve the problem with perl 5.8.2 under threaded
applications, since it no longer relies on the implicit context and
passes aTHX around. [Stas]

libapreq-1.3 is released.

=item 1.25 - August 23, 2003

Applied Graham Clark's patch to cleanup apache_request.h macros.
Added missing doc credits for Steve Hay in Request.pm. [joes]

=item 1.22 - July 5, 2003

Open uploaded files with binary mode (relevant for Perl > 5.7),

a mode makes a difference. Thanks to Steve Hay for first pointing
out this problem. [randyk]

=item 1.21 - June 25, 2003

=item 1.13 - April 18, 2003

Sync test suite uris with latest Apache::Test [Stas]

matches on "name" & "filename" keywords.  This feature allows uploads
from Nokia Series 60 phones to work as expected. [Oskari 'Okko' Ojala]

Patch Request.xs to revert to using pre-1.1 $upload->fh code for
pre-5.8 perls.  This patch may get backed out prior to 1.2's release,
unless it is known to resolve problems (zombies?) reported to occur 
with libapreq-1.1 uploads and pre-5.8 perls. [Joe]

=item 1.12 - February 27, 2003

do a better mod_perl version checking, including the test for mod_perl
2.0. [Stas]

Include patch and supporting documentation for OS X [David Wheeler].
Temporarily revert test suite to Apache::test. [Joe Schaefer]
Update Request.xs to avoid segfaults caused by empty file uploads

which triggered a segfault in $upload->fh [Sven Geisler].

=item 1.04 - November 5, 2002

Replace autogenerated files with BUILD.sh script. 
This is necessary for OS X support via libtool & friends.
